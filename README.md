## FAQ

### What was the motivation behind this project?

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contact with physical menus is a potential infection vector we could easily avoid. That and the fact that restaurant menus have a variety of needs that are hard to deal with on paper prompted us to develop this prototype.

### What is the cost for hosting my menu?

Currently, there is no cost associated with hosting your menu, except for a little bit of effort to create the menu in a compatible format. Other than that, it's entirely free. This might change in the future, as the project scales, but we'll inform you way ahead of time.
